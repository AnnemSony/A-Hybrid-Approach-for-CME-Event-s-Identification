Method,Description
Auto-Tuned Statistical Thresholding,Detects anomalies by auto-selecting statistical thresholds (z-score & percentile) for feature spikes.
Physics-Based Rule Detection,"Applies physically meaningful rules: high speed >500 km/s, density >5 cm⁻³, and flux >1e7."
Isolation Forest (Unsupervised ML),Applies anomaly detection on multivariate feature space using Isolation Forest algorithm.
Composite CME Score,"Combines weighted feature scores (flux, speed, density, thermal) into one composite metric."
Ensemble Flag Logic,"Combines results from stats, physics, and ML; flags event if 2 or more methods agree."
